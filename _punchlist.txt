/ The caption position doesn¹t seem practical. Let¹s go with Artist, Title, Date and place the rest of the information 

/ The movement of the images is much too fast. I understand why this is so based on the roulette controller, but I would 
prefer slower movement.

/ Can a touch reveal the caption info, a second touch reactive the movement so that we don¹t have to have a controller? I'm 
not sure how this impacts mobile.

x Would it be interesting to add a subliminal message? Happy New Year?

/ The spacing of the image bounding boxes can be lifted from the design of the printed card.

- click handlers to show captions
- captions divs, auto-populate
- captions css animate fade in
- updatestack() moves to next in stack
  updatecard() draws current in current state
  settimeout() not setinterval()
- establish closures clearly
- sound?

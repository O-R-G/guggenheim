- random write images in php (shuffle array there first!)

- We find the movement too slow now. It felt about right in the previous version. We would
prefer cuts to fades.

- rhythm

We think it is more like this ?^?^? red=change
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
Everything is changing on the same beat, but not all images change every
time. Typically one or two will change; once in a blue moon perhaps all
change simultalneously. (Happily, this will make the 60 or so images last a
long time before any repeat.) It may be that an image must always change in
order to realize that it has not stopped. Make sense?


- layout

Would prefer type in black; underlines need not be so heavy. Left align
footer content with Guggenheim logo.
When credits is clicked, captions should remain visible and 'Credits -?^?^?
should appear. Clicking anywhere closes credits and captions and restarts
rotation.
Credits should not cross over footer.
type full justify with hyphenation?
